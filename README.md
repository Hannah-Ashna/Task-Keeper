# Task Keeper (Android App)
Procrastination is a battle most are familiar with. It is also a point that is frequently brought up in conversations discussing the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on productivity. For our Practical Project Management (PPM) module at university, our team has decided to create a potential solution to this issue that is accessible to most of the population (via their mobile devices). Our idea is to use current research into the use of gamification as a tool to combat procrastination and implement it into a task-tracking or to-do list style mobile application (app).
