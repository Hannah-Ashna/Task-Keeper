        <h1>Project Management Team</h1>
        <h2>Ethan Wilde - Project Manager</h2>
        <p class="lead">The group designated Ethan as the overall Project Manager. This is because one of his responsibilities is to overlook the project's digital workplace (ClickUp); it, therefore, made sense to assign him with the responsibility of task management but also general team coordination to ensure work is completed efficiently and to a high standard of quality.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> As the project manager of the group, Ethan has been assigned the job of creating a list of talking points for the group's weekly meetings. These talking points are in place to ensure that meetings are conducted in a professional manner, similar to how meetings would be organised in the workplace.

        <h2>Hannah Ashna - Systems Manager/Deputy Project Manager</h2>
        <p class="lead">Hannah is going to work as the System Manager and Deputy Project Manager who will be heavily involved in and oversee all system development.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> This decision came down to her personal experience working on large-scale projects as a leading member of Dev Soc (Developer's Society at Nottingham Trent University) and the fact that she is the only member studying a course specialising in games technology. One of her responsibilities in this role will be to manage the group's code repository through GitHub. Thanks to Hannah, the group's Discord server was up and running pretty much instantly. Discord will act as the main platform of communication and will thus help the group achieve the goals and objectives outlined for this project.
