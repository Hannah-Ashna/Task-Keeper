			<h1>Project Management Team</h1>
			<h3>Ethan Wilde - Project Manager</h3>
			<p>The group designated Ethan as the overall Project Manager.
			This is because one of his responsibilities is to overlook the project's
			digital workplace (ClickUp); it, therefore, made sense to assign him with the responsibility
			of task management but also general team coordination to ensure work is completed efficiently
			and to a high standard of quality. 
			As the project manager of the group, Ethan has been assigned the job of creating
			a list of talking points for the group's weekly meetings. </p>
			<br>
			<h3>Hannah Ashna - Systems Manager/Deputy Project Manager</h3>
			<p>Hannah is going to work as the System Manager
			and Deputy Project Manager who will be heavily involved in and
			oversee all system development. This decision came down to her personal experience working on large-scale
			projects as a leading member of Dev Soc (Developer's Society at Nottingham Trent University)
			and the fact that she is the only member studying a course specialising in games technology.
			One of her responsibilities in this role will be to manage the group's code repository through GitHub.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h1>Software Development</h1>
			<h3>Ben Teft - Software Development/Head of Market Research</h3>
			<p>As a software developer, Ben will play an essential role in the group by ensuring a robust system will be developed.
			As head of market research, Ben is responsible for overseeing what information needs to be gathered and analysed.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h1> Testing Team </h1>
			<h3>Owen Rennie - Head of Testing/System Debugger</h3>
			<p>As head of system testing and system debugging, Owen will work with Simon to ensure the system is developed the same way it was designed.
			These two roles are essential to ensure the system is delivered to the high standards that have been set.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Simon Fincham - Head of User Acceptance/System Tester</h3>
			<p>As head of user acceptance, Simonâ€™s responsibility is to analyse client feedback
			throughout the project and feed that back to the rest of the team. Simon will work with Owen to thoroughly test the system.</p>
