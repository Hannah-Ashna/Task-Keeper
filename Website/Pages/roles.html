                  This is because one of his responsibilities is to overlook the project's digital workplace (ClickUp); 
                  it, therefore, made sense to assign him with the responsibility of task management but also general team coordination to 
                  ensure work is completed efficiently and to a high standard of quality. 
                  As the project manager of the group, Ethan has been assigned the job of creating
                  a list of talking points for the group's weekly meetings.</p>

                  and Deputy Project Manager who will be heavily involved in and
                  oversee all system development. This decision came down to her personal experience working on large-scale
                  projects as a leading member of Dev Soc (Developer's Society at Nottingham Trent University)
                  and the fact that she is the only member studying a course specialising in games technology.
                  One of her responsibilities in this role will be to manage the group's code repository through GitHub.</p>
